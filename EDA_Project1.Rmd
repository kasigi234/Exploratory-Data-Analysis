# Prenatal Tobacco Exposure and Child Outcomes

##    1.Introduction

Exposure to smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) are among the most widespread and harmful environmental factors that affect children. Approximately 7% to 15% of newborns each year are exposed to SDP, and over 25% of children are exposed to ETS within their homes. Dr Lauren Micalizzi's study seeks to examine self-regulation and substance use/externalizing behavior in youth who were prenatally exposed to smoking during pregnancy. It is hypothesized that early smoke exposure is associated with difficulties in self-regulation, early substance use and externalizing problems among children which affects their control of physiological, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive aspects. The primary objective is to examine the association between smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoking (ETS) exposure and self-regulation, externalizing behavior, and substance use.

##    2.Data

We use data collected from a randomly selected sub-population (N = 100) of mothers and their (12-16 years) adolescent children from a previous study on smoke avoidance intervention to reduce smoking and environmental tobacco smoking (ETS) exposure during pregnancy and exposure to ETS in the immediate postpartum period for children among low-income women. The data comprises mothers' and children's responses on smoking exposures both prenatal and postnatal, self-regulation, and substance use for children.  The data has been preprocessed and reduced to data with 49 observations for both mothers and their children measured over 78 variables on child exposure to smoke during and after pregnancy, as well as measurements for child behavior on externalizing, self-regulation, and substance. The independent and dependent variables to be used in the analysis are created based on the maternal report on smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoking (ETS) while the dependent variables are substance use (SU), externalizing problems (EXT), and self-regulation (SR). 

##    2.1 Data cleaning

Before performing any analysis further reprocessing was done to ensure that the data was clean from any anomalies and missingness. This involved cleaning the outliers, handling inconsistencies as well as missing data to ensure the quality and reliability of the data. All blank entries were re-recorded as NA values. **'mom_numcig'** which collects information on the mother's daily cigarettes consumption had several records that were abnormally different; "2 black and miles a day","20-25", "None" and "44989". These records were adjusted accordingly on the assumption that it meant the number and the average of cigarettes smoked while none simply meant 0 whereas 44989 as NA. **Income ** data had different formats for the entries and this was standardized. **'momcig'** had an outlier value of 40 which was adjusted to 4 assuming that it was a mistyped entry. Further cleaning involved data type transformation for binary and continuous variables. **'num_cigs_30'**, **'num_e_cigs_30'**, **'num_mj_30'**, **'num_alc_30'** which detailed child's substance use were originally recorded as NAs and this was adjusted to 0 if the child reported to be a non cigarette, e-cigarette, marijuana or alcohol user. This reduced the amount of missingness that were initially observed in the original data.

```{r}
# blank values to NA
project_data[project_data == ""] <- NA

# change the income input or row 6
project_data$income[6] <- 250000
project_data$income[1] <- 76000

# handle the outlier on momcig 
project_data$momcig[31] <- 4

# replace the erronously recorded value with NA
project_data[1, "mom_numcig"] <- 2
project_data[26, "mom_numcig"] <- NA # 44489
project_data[37, "mom_numcig"] <- 23  # 20-25
project_data[47, "mom_numcig"] <- NA  # none

# update 'num_cig_30' column to show true values
project_data <- project_data %>% mutate(num_cigs_30 = 
                                          case_when(cig_ever == 0 ~ 0,                               
                                          cig_ever == 1 ~ num_cigs_30,
                                          TRUE ~ NA))
# update 'num_e_cig_30' column
project_data <- project_data %>% mutate(num_e_cigs_30 = case_when(e_cig_ever == 0 ~ 0,
                                        e_cig_ever == 1 ~ num_e_cigs_30,
                                        TRUE ~ NA))
# update 'num_mj_30' column
project_data <- project_data %>% mutate(num_mj_30 = case_when(mj_ever == 0 ~ 0,
                                        mj_ever == 1 ~ num_mj_30,
                                        TRUE ~ NA))
# update 'num_alc_30' column
project_data <- project_data %>% mutate(num_alc_30 = case_when(alc_ever == 0 ~ 0,
                                        alc_ever == 1 ~ num_alc_30,
                                        TRUE ~ NA))

```

##    2.2 Missing Data

```{r}
# summary statistics for missing data 
missing_data <- data.frame(
  Variable = names(project_data),
  Missing_Count = sapply(project_data, function(x) sum(is.na(x)))
)
missing_data$Percentage_Missing <- missing_data$Missing_Count / nrow(project_data) * 100

missing_data <- missing_data %>%
  arrange(desc(Percentage_Missing))

# Remove row names
rownames(missing_data) <- NULL

# variables with missing values above 25%
missing_data_only <- missing_data %>%
  filter(Percentage_Missing > 25)

# percent of missingness
project_missing <- naniar::miss_var_summary(project_data, order = FALSE) 
project_missing$pct_miss <- round(project_missing$pct_miss, 2)

# Round off the values to 2 decimal places in the missing_data_only data frame
missing_data_only$Missing_Count <- round(missing_data_only$Missing_Count, 2)
missing_data_only$Percentage_Missing <- round(missing_data_only$Percentage_Missing, 2)

missing_data_only %>% 
  mutate_all(linebreak) %>%
kbl(caption = "Variables with 25% and More  Missing Data",
col.names = linebreak(c("Variable", "Proportion (%)", "n")),
booktabs = T, escape = F, align = "c") %>%
kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, latex_options = c('hold_position')) %>% 
row_spec(0, background = "black", color = "white")
```

```{r}

missing_data_only %>% 
  mutate_all(linebreak) %>%
kbl(caption = "Variables with 25% and More  Missing Data",
col.names = linebreak(c("Variable", "Proportion (%)", "n")),
booktabs = T, escape = F, align = "c") %>%
kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, latex_options = c('hold_position')) %>% 
row_spec(0, background = "black", color = "white")


```


From the above table ,we note that the '**mom_smoke_pp1**' which indicates whether the mother was smoking during the first postpartum visit has 79.6% of missingness, indicating a substantial amount of missing data which seems inconsistent with the other postpartum visits. '**childasd**' also exhibit relatively high percentage of missingness at 57% while the other variables have varying degrees of missingness, with less that 50% missingness. Several other variables, such as '**num_alc_30**', '**bpm_int**', '**pmq_parental_knowledge**','**pmq_parental_solicitation**'	are seen to be missing together at 28.57%. Similarly, '**bpm_att_p**', '**tsex**', '**nnum_e_cigs_30**','**alc_ever**','**erq_cog**','**erq_exp**' and '**pmq_child_disclosure**' variables are also missing together at 26.53. These findings underscore the importance of addressing the missing data. Considering the amount of data in this study, methods such as imputation of data may not be plausible as this is likely to induce bias into the estimates. Missing data for the variables of interest were excluded in the subsequent analysis.

Also, there appears to be a trend in the missingness across the variables. Most variables appear to be missing together. This consistent pattern suggests that the missingness is not at random (MNAR) indicating that there is a common factor influencing the data and these could be due to the unobserved factors which may be related to the nature of these variables and how they were measured during data collection or unobserved characteristics of the mothers and the children in this study that were not measured. For instance mothers with extremely high smoking habits are likely to be biased in their response as they might be less likely to disclose their true smoking behavior.

##    3. Analysis

## 3.1 Demographic summary statistics

```{r}
# summary table for demographic characteristics
tbl_summary_demographic <-  project_data %>%
  select(page,pedu, employ,tage , tsex, prace_other, trace_other) %>%
  tbl_summary(missing = "no", 
              label = list(page = "Mom Age", pedu = "Mom Education", employ = "Mom Employed",tage = "Child Age" , tsex = "Child Sex", prace_other = "Mom Other Race", trace_other = "Child Other Race")) 

# Convert tbl_summary to a data frame
data_frame <- tbl_summary_demographic %>%
  as_tibble()

# Define column names
column_names <- c("Variable", "N = 49") 
colnames(data_frame) <- column_names

# Convert the data frame to a knitr_kable object
kable_tbl <- data_frame %>%
  mutate_all(linebreak) %>%
kbl(caption = "Demographic Characteristics",
col.names = linebreak(c("Variable", "N = 49")),
booktabs = T, escape = F, align = "c") %>%
kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, latex_options = c('hold_position')) %>% 
row_spec(0, background = "black", color = "white")

kable_tbl
```
From the table, the average child age is 13 years with 36% being females. The mean age for mothers is 37 years with interquartile range of 35-39 years with 37% having some college education, 24% had 4 year degree education level while about 5% have a postgraduate degree. Slightly above half the mothers who participated in the study had full time jobs (54%), while about 29% being unemployed. This gives an understanding of the participants characteristics which may be potential confounding factors during the analysis.

For further analysis, the variables were grouped into independent (exposure) and dependent variables (outcome). The variables were based on the information on the questionnaires and how correlated the variables were based on correlation matrices. 

### 3.2 Aggregate Variable for Exposure

Exposures incorporated both trimester timing and dosage effect from prenatal cotinine levels which were informed by prospective maternal report on the questionnaires of smoking during and after pregnancy and the environmental tobacco smoking to come up with smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoking (ETS) variables. SDP was a composite for all the variables that relate to mothers smoking status during pregnancy as well as urine cotinine levels during pregnancy whereas ETS entailed all of the variables for smoke exposure post pregnancy and mother's urine cotinine levels as well as the babys. All these were combined to get a composite exposures.
Cotinine levels data were first transformed using the logarithmic scale and normalized before their inclusion in the composite. variable for SDP.


####    3.2.1 Interrelatedness of SDP and ETS

```{r}

# Standardize cotinine variable for mom and child
mom_cotimean_34_z <- abs(log(scale(project_data$cotimean_34wk)))
mom_cotimean_6mo_z <- abs(log(scale(project_data$cotimean_pp6mo)))
child_cotimean_6mo_z <-abs(log(scale(project_data$cotimean_pp6mo_baby)))

# calculate composite scores for SDP variable
project_data$SDP <- with(project_data, 
                         rowMeans(cbind(mom_numcig, mom_smoke_16wk, 
                                        mom_smoke_22wk, mom_smoke_32wk, 
                                        mom_cotimean_34_z),na.rm = TRUE))

# calculate composite scores for ETS variable
project_data$ETS <- with(project_data, 
                         rowMeans(cbind(mom_smoke_pp1, mom_smoke_pp2, 
                                        mom_smoke_pp12wk, mom_smoke_pp6mo, 
                                        smoke_exposure_6mo, smoke_exposure_12mo, 
                                        smoke_exposure_2yr, smoke_exposure_3yr,
                                        smoke_exposure_4yr,
                                        smoke_exposure_5yr,mom_cotimean_6mo_z,
                                        child_cotimean_6mo_z),na.rm = TRUE))


```

```{r}

                       midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1, 1), space = "Lab", 
                       #breaks = seq(-1, 1, by = 0.5)) +
                       name = "Correlation") +

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 1,
                                   size = 5, hjust = 1), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = "Correlation") +
  coord_fixed() +
  ggtitle("SDP and ETS Matrix")+
  labs(caption = "Figure 1: SDP vs ETS Correlation Matrix") 
```

Figure 1 above shows that smoke exposure during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco exposure (ETS) have a fairly positive correlation with each other indicating a weak interrelatedness of the smoking during pregnancy and environmental tobacco smoking composite variables for SDP and ETS were fairly correlated with each other.

## 3.3 Outcome Variables 

Similarly, the outcome variables included self regulation (SR), externalizing (Ext) problem and substance use. EXT and SR use were based on the responses to questions relating to emotional regulation, attention deficit and problem monitor from both the mother and the child. Potential correlations were assessed using a correlation matrix before the creation of the EXT and SR sub-groups. Substance use (SU) was created based on the child's response on any of the substances being studied. 

```{r}
# correlation matrix for SR/EXT
correlation_matrix_out <- cor(project_data[c("bpm_att", "bpm_ext", "bpm_att_p", 
                             "bpm_ext_p", "swan_inattentive", "swan_hyperactive",
                             "erq_exp","erq_cog","bpm_int", "bpm_int_p")], 
                          use ="complete.obs")

# reshape the correlation matrix for ggplot
melted_cor_matrix_out <- melt(correlation_matrix_out)

# correlation matrix visual
ggplot(melted_cor_matrix_out, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile() +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "blue", high = "red", mid = "white",
                       midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1, 1), space = "Lab", 
                       #breaks = seq(-1, 1, by = 0.5)) +
                       name = "Correlation") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 1,
                                   size = 5, hjust = 1), 
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5)) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = "Correlation") +
  coord_fixed() +
  ggtitle("Matrix for Outcome ")+
  labs(caption = "Figure 2: Correlation Matrix") 
```

Figure 2 above, shows that there is an evident correlation between the variables for externalizing and self regulation variables. This aligns with the descriptions on the codebook and the questionnaires relating to child externalizing and attention problem. Some other variables exhibit a fair correlation. These variables will then be categorized as either self regulation (SR) or externalizing (EXT).

### 3.3.1 Aggregate scores for EXT and SR

Before answering the primary objective for the analysis, an aggregate variable for the outcome was created. Basing on the correlation matrix for the outcome, two  groups were created for the EXT and SR. As seen earlier in the correlation matrix for the outcomes most of the variables were seen to be highly correlated. This enabled the creation of an aggregate variable for externalizing and self regulate variables separately while also basing on the provided codebook. The variables relating to attention and regulation scores were first normalized using Z-score to standardize the values to account for the different systems utilized during generation of the scores. 

```{r}

# Standardize SR, EXT variables for child
bpm_att_z = abs(scale(project_data$bpm_att))
bpm_ext_z = abs(scale(project_data$bpm_ext))
bpm_int_z = abs(scale(project_data$bpm_int))
erq_cog_z = abs(scale(project_data$erq_cog))
erq_exp_z = abs(scale(project_data$erq_exp)) 
erq_cog_a_z = abs(scale(project_data$erq_cog_a)) # exclude parent
erq_exp_a_z = abs(scale(project_data$erq_exp_a)) # exclude parent
bpm_att_p_z = abs(scale(project_data$bpm_att_p))
bpm_ext_p_z = abs(scale(project_data$bpm_ext_p))
bpm_int_p_z = abs(scale(project_data$bpm_int_p))
bpm_att_a_z = abs(scale(project_data$bpm_att_a)) # exclude parent
bpm_ext_a_z = abs(scale(project_data$bpm_ext_a)) # exclude parent
bpm_int_a_z = abs(scale(project_data$bpm_int_a)) # exclude parent
swan_hyperactive_z = abs(scale(project_data$swan_hyperactive))
swan_inattentive_z = abs(scale(project_data$swan_inattentive))

# calculate composite scores for self regulation variable
project_data$SR <- with(project_data, 
                        rowMeans(cbind(erq_cog_z, erq_exp_z, bpm_int_p_z, 
                                       bpm_int_z),na.rm = TRUE))

# calculate composite scores for externalizing variable
project_data$EXT <- with(project_data, 
                         rowMeans(cbind(bpm_att_z, bpm_ext_z, bpm_att_p_z,
                                        bpm_ext_p_z, swan_inattentive_z, swan_hyperactive_z),na.rm = TRUE))

# composite for substance use variable
project_data$SU <- with(project_data,
                        ifelse(cig_ever == 1 | e_cig_ever == 1 | 
                                 mj_ever == 1 | alc_ever == 1, 1, 0))

# correlation matrix for interrelatedness externalizing variables
correlation_matrix <- cor(project_data[c("bpm_att", "bpm_ext", 
                                         "bpm_att_p", "bpm_ext_p", "swan_inattentive", 
                                         "swan_hyperactive")], use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

# correlation matrix for interrelatedness self regulation
correlation_matrix2 <- cor(project_data[c("erq_exp", "erq_cog", "bpm_int", "bpm_int_p")], 
                           use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

# Load the tidyverse package
library(tidyverse)

# Assuming you have a data frame called 'your_data'
project_data %>%
  select(ETS, SDP, EXT, SR, SU) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_ETS = mean(ETS, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_SDP = median(SDP, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD_EXT = sd(EXT, na.rm = TRUE),
    Mean_SR = mean(SR, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median_SU = median(SU, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

```

### 3.3.2 Interrelatedness of the externalizing and self regulate behaviors in children
```{r}

  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, fill = "Correlation") +
  coord_fixed() +
  ggtitle("EXT vs SR Correlation Matrix")+
  labs(caption = "Figure 3: EXT/SR Matrix") 
```

Figure 3 shows that the externalizing and self regulate problems among the children are correlated suggesting that a child who exhibits externalizing problems is likely to experience self regulation problems.  

## 4. Effect of ETS on Externalizing problems

```{r}

# ETS on Externalizing problems
ggplot(project_data, aes(x = ETS, y = EXT)) +
  geom_point(size = 1, alpha = 0.7, color = "green") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 1.2, linetype = "solid", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Effect of Environmental tobacco smoking on EXT",
       x = "Environmental Tobacco Smoking",
       y = "Externalizing problems") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(caption = "Figure 4: Effect of Environmental Tobacco Smoking on Externalizing problems")

```

Figure 4 shows externalizing problems in children increases with increasing environmental tobacco smoking suggesting that children exposed to environmental tobacco smoking have capabilities to externalizing problems, self regulation and escalated substance use. Although no effect was notable for smoking during pregnancy on the outcomes. Linear models were later used to examine whether SDP had an effect on the outcomes with adjusted demographic characteristics. 

A linear model was

In our rigorous data analysis process, we recognized the critical importance of model selection to ensure that our statistical analysis accurately captures the relationship between environmental tobacco smoking (ETS) and externalizing problems (EXT). To achieve this, we evaluated various regression models, including linear regression, polynomial regression, and other advanced techniques. Each model was assessed based on its ability to fit the data, goodness of fit, and the presence of statistically significant predictors. After a comprehensive model selection process and thorough evaluation of model performance, we have identified the optimal model that best represents the association between ETS and EXT."

"After careful consideration and statistical analysis, the best model that emerged from our model selection process was the multiple linear regression model. This model was selected because it demonstrated a strong fit to the data, captured the linear relationship between ETS and EXT effectively, and provided interpretable coefficients that allowed us to quantify the impact of environmental tobacco smoking on externalizing problems. We also conducted diagnostic checks to ensure the model's assumptions were met. This selected model not only offers a robust understanding of the relationship in question but also serves as a reliable foundation for drawing conclusions and making informed decisions regarding the effects of ETS on externalizing problems."
