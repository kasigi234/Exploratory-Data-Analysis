# Exploratory Data Analysis
 The aim is to examine the effects of tobacco smoking during pregnancy  on  youths who were prenatally exposed to smoking.
The purpose of this project is to examine self regulation and substance use/externalizing behavior in youth who were prenatally exposed to smoking during pregnancy. We use data collected from a randomly selected sub-population $(\text {n} = 100)$ of mothers and their (12-16 years) adolescent children from a previous study on smoke avoidance intervention to reduce smoking and environmental tobacco smoking (ETS) exposure during pregnancy and exposure to ETS in the immediate postpartum period for children among low-income women.The main hypothesis was that children with greater early smoke exposure will demonstrate poorer self-regulation, earlier substance use initiation, faster substance use escalation and more externalizing behavior than non-exposed children. The dataset used for this analysis comprises mothers and children responses on smoking exposures both prenatal and postnatal, self regulation and substance use for children. The primary objective was to examine the association between smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoking (ETS) exposure and self regulation, externalizing behavior and substance use. The data has 49 observations for mothers and their children measured over 78 variables on child exposure to smoke during and after pregnancy reported by the mother,as well as measurements for the externalizing, self regulation and substance use as reported by the child and the mother on the child. The independent variables in the analysis are smoking during pregnancy (SDP) and environmental tobacco smoking (ETS) while the dependent variables are substance use (SU), externalizing problems (EXT) and self regulation (SR).
